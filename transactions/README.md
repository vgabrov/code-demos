This code analyzes a Poisson distribution using Python, with a focus on generating random data, estimating the parameter λ, and simulating λ with uncertainty. It compares observed data with expected values using a chi-square test.

Key Features:
	1.	Poisson Data Simulation: Generates random data for 365 days with λ=5.
	2.	λ Estimation: Calculates the mean and standard error of the data.
	3.	Simulated λ Values: Generates 10,000 simulated λ values using a normal distribution.
	4.	Expected Poisson Distribution: Calculates expected values based on the Poisson PMF.
	5.	Chi-Square Test: Compares observed and expected frequencies to check if the data fits the Poisson distribution.

An interactive widget is also included to calculate and display Poisson probabilities and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for different periods and event counts.
